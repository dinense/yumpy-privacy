# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: September 2024_

At Dinense UG, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our mobile application, **Yumpy**. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data.

## 1. Introduction

Yumpy is a mobile application developed by Dinense UG that allows users to view nearby restaurants on a map. We take your privacy seriously and have designed the app to ensure that **no personal information** is collected, stored, or shared while using Yumpy.

## 2. Information We Collect

**No personal data is collected.**

- **Location Information**: Yumpy requests access to your device’s location services to display nearby restaurants on a map. When using the app to search for nearby restaurants, your location data is **temporarily sent to our servers** to identify relevant places. However, this location data is kept **completely anonymous** and **is not stored** on our servers after the search is completed.
  
- **Non-Personal Information**: We may collect non-personally identifiable information such as app usage statistics (e.g., how often the app is used, what features are accessed). This information is collected to improve the performance of the app and enhance the user experience. **No user-specific or identifiable information** is linked to this data.

## 3. How We Use the Information

- **Location Data**: Your location data is used solely for the purpose of identifying restaurants near your current location. The location data is anonymized, sent temporarily to our servers, and discarded after the search is completed. **We do not store, share, or retain your location information**.
  
- **Non-Personal Usage Data**: Any non-personal usage data that we collect is used to improve the app's performance and functionality. This data does not include any personal identifiers.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **We do not share or sell any personal data.**
  
As Yumpy does not collect personal information, there is no data that we can share with third parties. We do not engage in selling or renting any user data to external services or partners.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Yumpy may integrate third-party services such as Google Maps to display restaurant locations. These services may collect anonymized data to improve their own services, such as map accuracy or service performance. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party service providers used within the app.

## 6. Your Consent

By using Yumpy, you consent to the limited data collection practices outlined in this policy. If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, you should discontinue using the app.

## 7. Data Security

Although we do not collect or store personal data, we are committed to ensuring that any non-personal information we collect is handled securely. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect data from unauthorized access or misuse.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

Yumpy is not designed for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal data from children. Since no personal information is collected, the app is safe for use by all age groups.

## 9. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or relevant legal requirements. Any changes will be posted within the app, and the updated policy will be effective as of the "Last Updated" date mentioned above. We encourage you to periodically review this policy for any updates.
